* st - simple terminal

This is a fork of the excellent [st](https://st.suckless.org/) terminal by Suckless (most recently based on st-0.8.1).
~st~ is configured by forking and applying appropriate patching and source modifications.
This repository constitutes my personal configuration of ~st~.


** Requirements
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.

** Installation
Edit ~config.mk~ to match your local setup (st is installed into the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if necessary as root):

#+begin_src sh
    make clean install
#+end_src

** Changes From the Default:

- All [[https://st.suckless.org/patches/scrollback/][scrollback]] patches have been applied.
- The font has been set to FiraCodeNerd.
- The cursor has been configured to be a red I-beam style.
- Experimental support for sixel graphics has been added.
  There are several known issues:
  + Entering ~clear~ causes *all* sixels to be deleted from scrollback.
  + Rendering sixel graphics may cause unusual cursor placement, this is not specific to this variant of st - the same issue is present in the xterm implementation. This is likely an issue of sixel height
not being detected correctly.

- Preliminary support for some additional control sequences has been added, namely OSC 11 and 10 with more planned.
- CSI S and T escape behavior has been modified to fix a bug where S or T escapes would sometimes cause lines to be deleted from the scrollback buffer.
